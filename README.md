FIFO-LIFO Visualizer <br><br>
Developed by: Iffath Sanjida[232-115-222] (Stack Module) & Fariba Diya Ahmad[232-115-229] (Queue Module) <br><br>

Overview<br>
The FIFO-LIFO Visualizer is a Java Swing application that provides an interactive and visual representation of two fundamental data structures: Stack (LIFO) and Queue (FIFO). Users can perform operations like push/pop for stacks and enqueue/dequeue for queues while observing animations that illustrate how these structures work internally.<br><br>
