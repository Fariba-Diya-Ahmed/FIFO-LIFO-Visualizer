## Overview
The **LIFO-FIFO Visualizer** is a **Java Swing application** that provides an interactive and visual representation of two fundamental data structures: **Stack (LIFO)** and **Queue (FIFO)**. Users can perform operations like **push/pop** for stacks and **enqueue/dequeue** for queues while observing animations that illustrate how these structures work internally.

## Features

### Welcome Screen
- Intuitive welcome frame with **Stack** and **Queue** options.  
- Images representing each data structure for easy identification.  

### Stack Visualizer (LIFO)
- Push elements onto the stack.  
- Pop elements from the stack.  
- Clear the stack entirely.  
- Dynamic animation visualizing stack behavior.  
- Highlights the **Top** element.  
- Stack size is **user-defined** (1–10).  

### Queue Visualizer (FIFO)
- Enqueue elements into the queue.  
- Dequeue elements from the queue.  
- Clear the queue entirely.  
- Animated visualization of element movements.  
- Highlights **Front** and **Rear** elements.  
- Queue size is **user-defined** (1–10).
